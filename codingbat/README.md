# Codingbat Exercises

This is the base repo for codingbat (<http://codingbat.com/python>) exercises. For each type of exercises, I provided solution to the first question. Please follow my coding style (docstrings, testing, etc.) to solve the rest of questions.

This exercise is optional. There is no grading pressure or timing pressure. However, I strongly recommand you try all the questions without other's help. **DO NOT google the solutions.**  

## How to submit

1. Fork this base repository.
2. Clone this base repository to your computer. This repository should be a different folder from the one you are using for class demo code and in-class activities and the folders for assignments.
3. Read my solution demo code before you start.
4. Commit and sync to GitHub when you finish one or several exercises. Check the update on your personal GitHub page.
5. If you have difficulty solving problems, you can eiter
    - mention me in issues of your codingbat repo
    - or open a pull request to the base repo
    - or DM me on Slack.
6. (Occasionally, in fact very rarely) If I need to check your progress in solving codingbat problems, I will ask you to open a pull request to my base repo and we will have a Coding Chat the following days. 

Please email me if you have any question.
